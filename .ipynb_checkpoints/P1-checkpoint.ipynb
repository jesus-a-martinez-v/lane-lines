    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

Most functions do not perform necessary checks on the input data, which leads to runtime errors very difficult to spot. The use of global state to keep the detected lane lines steady in the videos (i.e., the history dict) harms the reusability and overall transparency of the code; a more functional approach would be a good fit here._\n",

The region mask isn't very wide, so a different camera setting or placing would probably break the pipeline. Some default parameters for the Hough Transform, Gaussian Blur and Canny Edge Detection algorithms would improve the code's flexibility._\n",
